## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Components

#### Core Dashboard Components:
1. **DashboardLayout**: Main layout wrapper with title and subtitle
2. **DashboardCard**: Reusable card component with loading and error states
3. **StatCard**: Statistics display with trend indicators and icons
4. **QuickActions**: Interactive action buttons with navigation and click handlers
5. **ProgressBar**: Visual progress indicators with multiple color themes
6. **DataTable**: Reusable table component with loading states

#### Component Structure:
```
client/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/dashboard/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DashboardLayout.jsx
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DashboardCard.jsx

    â”œâ”€â”€ AdminDashboard.jsx
    â”œâ”€â”€ AgencyDashboard.jsx
    â””â”€â”€ UserDashboard.jsx
```

### Backend Implementation

#### New Routes and Controllers:
1. **Dashboard Routes** (`/routes/dashboardRoutes.js`):
   - Admin-only routes with `isAdmin` middleware
   - Protected routes for authenticated users
   - Separate endpoints for different dashboard types

2. **Dashboard Controller** (`/controllers/dashboardController.js`):
   - `getAdminDashboardStats()`: Aggregates system-wide statistics
   - `getAgencyDashboardStats()`: Provides business analytics (currently mock data)
   - `getUserDashboardStats()`: Personal user statistics and recommendations
   - `getPackageAnalytics()`: Detailed package distribution analysis
   - `getUserEngagementStats()`: User engagement and behavior metrics

#### Database Integration:
- Integrates with existing models: User, Package, AmiTravel, HolidayGoGo, PulauMalaysia, GeocodeCache
- Uses MongoDB aggregation for complex statistics
- Efficient queries with parallel data fetching

### Navigation Integration

#### Updated Navigation Menu:
- **My Dashboard**: User dashboard access for all users
