# CPU Selection Guide for Travel Agency Platform

## 🎯 **Recommended: Regular (Shared CPU) - $24/month**

### **Perfect for your Travel Agency Platform because:**

```
🕷️ Web Scraping Performance:
├── 2 vCPUs handle Puppeteer + Chrome efficiently
├── Shared CPU bursts when needed for scraping
├── Can scrape 3 providers (AmiTravel, HolidayGoGo, PulauMalaysia)
└── Background cron jobs run smoothly

🗄️ Database Performance:
├── 4GB RAM: Comfortable for MongoDB + data caching
├── 2 vCPUs: Handle database queries + indexing
├── SSD storage: Fast package search and filtering
└── Can store 50k+ package records easily

🌐 Web Server Performance:
├── Node.js + Express API: Handles 100+ concurrent users
├── React frontend: Static files served efficiently
├── File uploads: Process images without issues
└── Real-time features: WebSocket support available

💰 Cost Efficiency:
├── Starting budget-friendly at $24/month
├── Room in budget for MongoDB Atlas ($60/month) if needed
├── Can always upgrade without data loss
└── Total initial cost: $24-84/month vs $200+ enterprise
```

## 📊 **Performance Expectations with Regular CPU:**

### **Current Workload Capacity:**
- **Concurrent Users**: 50-100 simultaneous users
- **API Requests**: 1000+ requests per minute
- **Scraping**: All 3 providers in 15-30 minutes
- **Database**: 50,000+ package records
- **Storage**: 80GB (plenty for images + backups)

### **Growth Headroom:**
- **Users**: Can scale to 200+ users before needing upgrade
- **Data**: Can handle 100k+ packages before performance impact
- **Traffic**: Supports moderate production traffic
- **Features**: Room for additional functionality

## 🔄 **Easy Upgrade Path:**

### **When you outgrow Regular CPU:**
```bash
# DigitalOcean allows seamless upgrades:
1. Resize droplet (takes 1-2 minutes)
2. No data loss or configuration changes
3. Pay only the difference in price
4. Scale up/down as needed
```

### **Upgrade Triggers:**
- ✅ **100+ concurrent users regularly**
- ✅ **Scraping takes >45 minutes**
- ✅ **API response times >500ms**
- ✅ **Database queries slow down**
- ✅ **Revenue justifies higher hosting costs**

## 💡 **Pro Tips:**

### **Optimize Regular CPU Performance:**
```bash
# These optimizations make Regular CPU perform even better:
- Use PM2 clustering (utilize both CPUs)
- Enable MongoDB indexing (faster queries)
- Implement Redis caching (reduce database load)
- Optimize Puppeteer (headless mode, resource limits)
- Use CDN for static assets (reduce server load)
```

### **Monitor Performance:**
```bash
# Watch these metrics to know when to upgrade:
- CPU usage consistently >80%
- Memory usage >90%
- API response times >1 second
- Scraping failures due to timeouts
- User complaints about slow loading
```

## 🎯 **Bottom Line:**
**Regular CPU at $24/month is perfect for:**
- ✅ Development and testing
- ✅ Small to medium user base (1-100 users)
- ✅ Learning and building your business
- ✅ Proving concept before scaling
- ✅ Budget-conscious deployment

**Upgrade later when you have:**
- 💰 Steady revenue from the platform
- 👥 Growing user base (100+ users)
- 📈 Performance bottlenecks
- 🚀 Need for enterprise features
